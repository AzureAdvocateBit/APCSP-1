                                using Data Structures. Suppose we want a simple animation of a fish, swimming across the screen from left-to-right. We can imagine
                                a series of frames, where the fish is a little further to the right in each frame:

                                 Now look at the body of @code{draw-world}. It's using a function you might remember, called @code{put-image}, which takes
                                 in an image, and then places it on top of another image, using the x- and y-coordinates to determine where to put it. In this example, it 
                                 is placing the @code{DOG} onto the @code{BACKGROUND}. Notice that it's using the number @code{400} for the dog's y-coordinate,
                                 and the variable @code{current-world} as dog's x-coordinate. As the value of @code{current-world} changes, the dog will appear
                                 to move across the screen. The dog will appear to move to the right if this value gets larger, or to the left if it gets smaller.
