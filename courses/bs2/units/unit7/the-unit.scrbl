In one dimension, such as on a number line, finding the distance is pretty easy. If the characters are on the same line, you just subtract one coordinate from another, and you have your distance. However, if all we did was subtract the second number from the first, the function would only work half the time!

However, having students write out the full test and result gets them thinking about what exactly is being tested in each branch of the function.

How many characters will you have, and what will you need to have in your World? You can use Numbers to keep track of the score, or the characters' x- and y-coordinates. You can also store an Image in the world, so that your character can change the way they look or to swap out the background once the score reaches a certain level. Once you have a simple game, it's easy to add more pieces to the World.
