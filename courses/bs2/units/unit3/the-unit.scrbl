We know our customer will expect to get a Cake back: you wouldn't return a Cake made incorrectly to a bakery and be OK with only getting a frosting message back!

This way the function does not return the same value it was given, but instead creates a Cake with the same specs as the given Cake, where only the flavor is different.
