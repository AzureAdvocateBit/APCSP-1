                      This function is the same as the @code{cost} function you worked with in Bootstrap:1, except this one is written in Pyret! @code{cost} will still take in a String, representing a pizza topping, in its domain, and give back a number for its range, representing the price of that pizza. In Pyret, instead of using @code{cond} branches, we use a keyword called @code{ask}, which lets the computer know we're going to have different situations and behavior in our code. Just like you learned in Bootstrap:1, this is known as a @vocab{Piecewise function}. Each ask statement starts with the '|' key, (known as 'pipe') followed by a test, or an expression that produces a @vocab{Boolean} (either true or false). The other keyword to know here is @code{then:}. This tells the computer that whatever follows is what will be returned if the preceding expression is @bold{true}. In the case of this function, if the string representing the topping (@code{topping}) is equal to the string "pepperoni" (@code{string-equal(topping, "pepperoni")}), @italic{then} the function will return 10.50.
                       @activity[#:forevidence (list "BS-IDE&1&1")]{Have students practice adding their own pizza toppings to the menu, and asking the @code{cost} function for the price of those toppings.}}
                      @teacher{@code{string-equal} is exactly the same as @code{string=?} in Racket. It takes two Strings in its domain and returns a Boolean, telling you whether or not the given strings are equal. Have students copy the contract for this function
                                  into their contracts page.}}
                 @point{@student{In Racket we had an @code{else} clause, that would return true when all other tests had failed. In Pyret, we have the @code{otherwise:} keyword, which behaves the same way. If we didn't have this line of code our program would crash if someone tried to order a pizza that was not on the menu, like "anchovies", or "mushroom". This way, if you order off the menu, the function returns 0. A free pizza!}
                         @teacher{@code{otherwise} clauses are best used as a catch-all for cases that you can’t otherwise enumerate. If you can state a precise 
                                   question for a clause, write the precise question instead of otherwise. For example, if you have a function that does
                                   different things depending on whether some variable @code{x} is larger than @code{5}, it is better for beginners to
                                   write the two questions @code{(> x 5)} and @code{(<= x 5)} rather than have the second question be @code{otherwise}. 
                                   Explicit questions make it easier to read and maintain programs. When you use @code{otherwise}, someone has to read
                                   all the previous questions to know what condition else corresponds to: they can’t just skim all the questions 
                                   to find the one that matches their situation. This makes code more readable and understandable.}}
                 @point{@student{One final syntax note: notice that there are two @code{end} statements at the bottom of this function. One to close the @code{ask:} branches and one to close the function itself. Whenever you write a @vocab{piecewise function} in Pyret, you will need to remember to add two @code{end} statements in order to finish the function.}
