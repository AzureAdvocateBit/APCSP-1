                                    The parachute jumper jumps out of the airplane and falls straight down, into the water! It's much safer to land on the shore. Let's take a look at the code to see why he falls into the water instead.
                                    @activity[#:forevidence (list "8.F.1-3&1&1" "8.F.5&1&1" "F-IF.1-3&1&1" "A-SSE.1-2&1&1" "A-SSE.1-2&1&3")]{Look at the function defined here called @code{next-position}. @itemlist[@item{What is this function's Domain? Its Range?}
          @item{What does @code{next-position} do with its inputs?}]}
                                    This function takes in two numbers, representing the x and y coordinate of the jumper, but it changes and returns only the y-coordinate, by subtracting 5 from it. But if only the y-coordinate is changing, he'll always fall straight down, landing in the water every time. To reach the land, he'll have to fall diagonally. How could we make that happen?
                                    @activity[#:forevidence (list "F-LE.5&1&1")]{How should the jumper's x-coordinate change if he moves diagonally to the right (toward the land)? How should his y-coordinate change?}}

                    @point{@student{Functions can return only one thing at a time, but we need to return both an x @bold{and} a y-coordinate in order to make the jumper move diagonally. Thankfully, we have a way to combine multiple things within one container, called a @vocab{Data Structure}.

@code[#:multi-line #t]{# coord : Number Number -> Coord}}
                            @teacher{Point out the difference in capitalization: Coord (capital C) is the name of the data structure, while @code{coord} (lowercase c) is the name of the function that creates a Coord. Make sure students understand the difference, because this is a required distinction between the structure name (capitalized) and constructor function (always lowercase).}}
                    
                    @point{@student{Now it's up to us to protect the parachute jumper, and make sure he lands safely on the shore. @activity[#:forevidence (list "F-IF.1-3&1&1" "F-LE.5&1&1" "BS-M&1&2" "BS-DR.1&1&1" "BS-DR.1&1&2")]{Turn to @worksheet-link[#:page 10 #:name "next-position"] in your workbook, read the word problem, and fill in the Contract and Purpose Statement for the function @code{next-position}.}

                           # Given 2 numbers, make a Coord by adding 5 to x and subtracting 5 from y}
    
    Now for our two examples. Using, or @vocab{calling} @code{next-position} with two numbers is easy, but what happens to those numbers? We can't return both at the same time... unless we use a data structure! To do so we'll need to use the constructor function to make a structure from data we already have. @activity[#:forevidence (list "5.OA.1-2&1&1" "5.OA.1-2&1&1" "7.EE.3-4&1&1" "A-SSE.1-2&1&1" "BS-DR.2&1&1" "BS-DR.2&1&3" "BS-DR.4&1&1")]{@itemlist[@item{According to the definition for @code{Coord}, what function makes a Coord?}

                                   Now that we know everything that is part of a Cake, we can use a data structure to represent the Cake itself. Let's take a look at how this works.
                                   @activity{Open your workbook to @worksheet-link[#:page 11 #:name "Cake"].}
                                   At the top of this page we see a comment, stating what things are part of a Cake. Below that is a line that says @code{data Cake:}, which begins the definition of a new data structure, called Cake. On the next line, we define the function that makes a Cake (@code{cake}), and how @italic{exactly} to make a Cake - the names of each thing in a Cake structure, and their data types. 
                                   @activity{What is the first part of a Cake structure? What data type can we use to represent it?}
                                   There is a little bit of new syntax involved in defining structures. On the first line on @worksheet-link[#:page 11 #:name "Cake"], we want to write @code{flavor :: String,}, which tells Pyret that the first element of @italic{any} Cake will be its flavor, represented by a String. 
                                   @activity{What is the second part of a Cake structure? What data type can we use to represent it?}
                                   On the next line, write @code{color :: String}, which tells Pyret that the second element of any Cake will be its color, represented by a String.
                                   @activity[#:forevidence (list "N-Q&1&1")]{List each of the other fields of a cake (message, layers, and is-ice-cream), and note what data types will represent them. Don't forget commas to separate each field!}
                                   On your paper, you should have: 
                                   @code[#:multi-line #t]{ # a Cake is a flavor, color, message, number of layers, and whether or not it is an ice cream cake.

                                                             flavor      :: String, 
                                                             color       :: String, 
                                                             message     :: String, 
                                                             layers      :: Number,

                                                       end}
                             This is the code that defines the Cake data structure. It tells the computer what a Cake is and what goes into it. It also defines its constructor function, called @code{cake}. To make a Cake, you @italic{must} call the constructor function with five things: a @code{flavor}, which is a String, @code{color}, a String, @code{messgae}, another String, @code{layers}, a Number, and @code{is-iceCream}, which is a Boolean. Remember that order matters! For now, these are the only things that we're going to keep track of in a cake, but you can imagine how you might extend it to include other information.}
