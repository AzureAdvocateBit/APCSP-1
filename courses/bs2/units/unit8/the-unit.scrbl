Background images should be 640x480, and character images should generally be no larger than 200px in either dimension. Make sure that the character images have transparent backgrounds! TIP: use animated GIFs for the characters - not only does the animation make the game look a lot better, but these images usually have transparent backgrounds to begin with.}

It takes in an image, the coordinates for where to put the image, and another image, on top of which the first image is placed.
@code[#:multi-line #t]{# put-image(Image, Number, Number, Image) -> Image
                       # Places the first image at the given x and y-coordinates on top of the second image}

                                                             @item{But you probably don't want your image to be at the center of the background. Look back at the sketches you made on @worksheet-link[#:page 32 #:name "Game Design"]. You made a note of which coordinates you wanted that image to be, placed on top of the background.}]}
                                        Start with something that looks like this, substituting YOUR image and coordinates (or dot-accessors):
@code[#:multi-line #t]{fun draw-world(current-world):
                         ...
                         ...
                         ...
                         put-image(IMAGE, 320, 240, BACKGROUND)
                       end}
Remember, if the position of these images will be changing (like the dog and coin moving across the screen in Ninja World), they won't always be placed at the same coordinates. Instead of using specific numbers in @code{put-image}, you can (and should!) use @vocab{dot-accessors} to access the coordinates of the characters in the world. Your own world struct will determine which dot-accessors you have available.

Here is an example of using @code{draw-world} in our Ninja World game, using @code{worldA}:
@code[#:multi-line #t]{draw-world(worldA) is 
                       put-image(NINJA-IMG, worldA.catX, worldA.catY,
                         put-image(COIN-IMG, worldA.coinX, 300,
                           put-image(DOG-IMG, worldA.dogX, worldA.dogY,
                             put-image(CLOUD-IMG, 500, 400, BACKGROUND-IMG))))}
                                         @activity[#:forevidence (list "BS-M&1&1" "BS-IDE&1&1" "BS-IDE&1&2" "BS-PL.3&1&1" "BS-DS.1&1&5" "BS-W&1&2")]{@itemlist[@item{Place another one of your images on top of the one that your first @code{put-image} expression has created.

            @code[#:multi-line #t]{examples:
                                     next-world(worldA) is

            In the first example, we create a new World (using the @code{world} constructor function) by adding 10 to the @code{dogX} of @code{worldA}, and subtracting 5 from its @code{coinX}. 
            In the second example, we do the same thing, only with @code{worldB}.

It determines what changes from one second to the next, and updates the world accordingly. Make sure students are making a new world with @code{world}, and using their dot- accessors to change the value of each world field according to their game's behavior. This function will likely change drastically in the next few units (just like in Ninja World), and students start adding new functionality to their games.
