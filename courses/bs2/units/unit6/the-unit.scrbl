Here is the contract for the greater than function:

Additionally, from a programming point of view, it makes sense to use the specific screen boundaries in as few functions as possible: If a programmer wants his or her game to be playable on a larger screen (such as a tablet), they will have to go through their code and change every function that tests boundaries based on the old screen size, 640x480. If only the @code{is-off-right} and @code{is-off-left} functions use the screen size, the programmer can make a few quick changes to the numbers, instead of searching through @code{ask} branches such as in the second example.}}

Then, re-write your third condition in @code{next-world} to use this function to determine if the cat is off the ground. This will make your code more readable, and you can easily edit the boundaries if the image of the cat changes to a smaller or larger image.}
       @teacher{What happens if the dog and coin reach the boundaries @italic{at the same time}? The computer reads @code{ask} branches in order, so it will evaluate the first true condition and change the World accordingly. If the first branch checks the dog’s x-coordinate, and the dog and coin reach the boundaries at the same time, the dog’s position will be updated one (mostly-imperceptible) frame before the coin’s.
